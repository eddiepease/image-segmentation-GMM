# Image Segmentation with Gaussian Mixture Models

This repo does a basic image segmentation using GMMs. It was trained to identify 'apple' pixels and 'non-apple' pixels. The code is written using MATLAB and implements the expectation maximisation algorithm from scratch.

## File Structure
* main.m - trains the GMM and tests on an image
* load_data.m - a script load in both the train and test images and ground-truth masks
* **images** - folder of both train and test images
* **masks** - ground truth masks for the test and train images
